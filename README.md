This software is not based on any dependacies beside what is included in it's root directory. This means that in the future so long as python is still working
and doesn't remove any modules or compatibility it should work forever.

This software was designed for my needs as I wanted to build a firework launcher. My goal was to come in at about half or very close to half the cost of a
professional grade Launching system. Either that or the radio controlled ones on amazon. However this software can and will run as just a way to control GPIO/GPIO
expansion boards (primarily the MCP23017 based ones which i used). This meaning you could use it for literally anything that you want to control with GPIO on raspberry pi.

If you have any suggestions on modifications to the python code or any of it really. I'm always interedsted to hear new ways to write code especially shorter ones. :)

      Note: please use "Launcer Project" in the subject if you email me. I rarely check my email but I would be sure to read and write back if I see that.

Also you will need to install eel from pip or this repository to run the backend from the JavaScript to python.
